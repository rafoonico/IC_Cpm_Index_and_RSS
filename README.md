# IC_Cpm_Index_and_RSS
This repository it's for a research project wich me and professor Cesar Taconelli got enrolled from July 2018 to September 2019, during my bachelor program. Here in Brazil, it's called "Iniciação Científica" wich literaly translates to "Scientific Initiation".

So, this project was about comparing simple random sampling  (SRS) against ranked set sampling (RSS) for estimating Cpm indexes. We conducted a simulation study which we evaluated through different cenarios a few kinds of Cpm Confidence Intervals, and concluded that the bootstrap confidence intervals with RSS got the best performance for estimating Cpm indexes. 

More details to be given.
